              Back in 2016, I started my career as a developer without even
              realizing it. I tried to build a web page with basic HTML, CSS and
              Javascript just as a hobby. I found out that programming was
              actually fun. So I kept learning, practicing, and hacking things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, Iâ€™ve had diverse experiences in the development world:
              from working with multiple clients as an indie freelancer, to be
              part of a whole team of amazing developers following an agile
              methodology.
